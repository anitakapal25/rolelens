# Decisions log

One line per decision: what was chosen, what was rejected, and why.
Raw notes — rewrite in your own words when turning these into the README.

## Locked stack

| Decision | Pick | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Option | 4 — Career Intelligence Assistant | I can judge answer quality myself with my own resume |
| Backend | Python + FastAPI, SSE streaming | Fastest path to a streaming API I can explain |
| Frontend | Vite + React + Tailwind | No SSR complexity, fast iteration |
| Vector DB | Chroma (Docker) | Zero-config, persists to disk, swappable |
| Embeddings | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` | Cheap, strong, 1536-dim |
| LLM | Claude (Sonnet for answers, Haiku for routing/extraction) behind a thin client | Shows orchestration without a framework; cheap model where quality matters less |
| Orchestration | Hand-rolled, no LangChain | Every step is visible and debuggable; fewer dependencies |

## Log

### M1 — Scaffold
- Layered layout (`api/ingest/retrieval/llm/eval`) over a flat `app/` — rejected flat because routes would end up holding business logic.
- `.env` gitignored before first real commit; `.env.example` lists every key — rejected committing a sample `.env` because it is too easy to fill in and push.
- Python 3.12 for the backend (local and Docker) — rejected system Python 3.14 because some wheels (PyMuPDF, chromadb) lag new releases.

## AI workflow
(Filled in from M2 onward: where the assistant saved time, what I rewrote, what I refused to let it touch.)
